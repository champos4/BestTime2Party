# BestTime2Party
A project that helps a young boy that wants to go into a festival and take photos with the most possible music bands!
There is a young boy who would like to be in a festival where the most famous music bands will be there. One problem is that the bands will not be all there at the same time and secondly the boy can go only for one hour as he has to study. With this C project, he can put data like which hour every band will be there, so he could find the best time to go there and get photos with as many possible bands!
